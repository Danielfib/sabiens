Creating tools for test the knowledgement of the students of the project

Brazilian public schools still suffer from a deficit in education, related to the devaluation of the educator, lack of students and lack of technological knowledge to enhance and improve education, despite the progress achieved in education in the fields of technology, job training and change in teaching method which were key to greater social development and the country. But many schools have a lack of very large stimulus, both educators and by the students, to engage in the teaching-learning process. This project seeks to address, clearly, different means in science education classes, elementary level, involving the content of the human body, providing practical lessons of Human Anatomy in public schools in the city of Recife. Looks ahead for a better interaction between theoretical knowledge and practical model, allows a better understanding of body structures by students, as well as alternative activities such as the construction of some structures and organ in the body made by the students in their schools to consolidate learning theoretical and practical and allow the structuring of a mini collection for schools involved in the project and the construction of virtual games and / or sites for stimulating study. This methodology has helped to complement the subject making a rescue of attention and interest of both the student and the teacher in the knowledge construction process. The result so far makes us observe an increase in self-esteem of students and an interest in participation in school activities.
